# CKDPredictor is a statistical report using supervised learning techniques to predict the presence of chronic kidney disease(CKD) within a patient.
# (Click on the Notebook to view it On Github!)

# What does this project do?
I decided to predict whether or not a patient had the disease based off given parameters, hence a supervised learning process.
This project incorporates the complete Data Science workflow from cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis, transforming, visualizing, modelling,
and interpreting the data. 

# What did I use?
I primarily performed my work in a Jupyter notebook using R to manage my data (a CSV file). I credit a lot of my analysis to existing
libraries like the tidyverse (data cleaning), caRet (classification/regreeion algorithms), and GGally/ggplot(data visualization).


# How the data was obtained
It uses anonymized hospital patient data that was donated to UCI for research purposes: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic_kidney_disease
More information and credits can be found within my report.


# Results 
In the project, we were able to create a model which obtains 100% test accuracy in predicting the presence of kidney disease.
Methods that helped us achieve this accuracy include feature selection, cross-validation, and eliminating incomplete data.
Our report contains reasons for why we used such methods and counterpoints against using these methods for further research.
